  Example("This is the best novel I have read in 2 or 3 years.  It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop 'my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me' trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are. Anyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature. I was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh... I hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work.", "positive"),
  Example("Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and 'truths' within the story. It's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read.", "neutral"),
  Example("This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history. Potential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria. The focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences. Sagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.  It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States. For me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.", "positive"),
  Example("What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism. The story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!", "positive"),
  Example("I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the 'bildung?'  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph. I do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way. If you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.", "neutral"),

  Example("This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V.", "negative"),

  Example("I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning.", "negative"),

  Example("First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first. Yes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY.", "positive"),

Rand McNally folks seem to be working to continue to improve the software along with prompt updates.  Although designed for the trucking industry it works great for us RV folks as well.  I found for a 2500 HD pickup the unit is a little large for the windshield.  I use the unit with a mount that fits in my cup holder and that has worked out great.  I would recommend this product.", "positive"),

  Example("I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.", "negative"),
  Example("I am seriously wondering if I read the same books as everyone else.  I began reading with high hopes for two great thrillers based on other reviews, but I was sorely disappointed.  First of all, the sentence structure was choppy, with many sounding as of they were written by my eight year old.  Secondly, in an ill-conceived effort at humor, the protagonist comes off like a self-righteous jerk--and a sexist one at that.  Third, there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in the kindle edition ('accept' instead of 'except'--twice, by the way...) that I wanted to take a red pen and edit the book myself!  Both books made for an interesting afternoon read, but the second book's big 'shocker' I had pegged as soon as the character was introduced!  Overall, I was not impressed, but I will read the third book just to see where the story goes.", "negative"),
  Example("Nice mix of mystery and humor.  Good book to read on vacation.  Characters (and they really are) are interestingly developed.", "positive"),
  Example("It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hub It does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug.", "neutral"),
  Example("I bought this thinking it would be a great replacement for my worn power cable.  It charged my nook HD+ and my son's nook for a few weeks and then my son said it stopped working.  Sure enough, I did not even get 6 months of use out of it even though it was an original cable (it came in an OEM box). I ended up borrowing my mom's charger and charging my Nook HD+.  I then wiped the device and will put the Nook app on a generic Samsung tablet.  My Nook HD+ still works, but given all of the new Android exploits, lack of third party chargers that can last as long as the original, and the fact Barnes and Noble no longer supports it I cannot see keeping it any longer when newer tablets are faster.", "negative"),

The only reason I gave it three stars was I was able to solve the problem by trimming the plastic edge down  with a razor blade,  this allowed the plug to engage more securely.  Perhaps I got a bad unit since others don't seem to have this problem. Also,  you have to have it plugged into a power supply to work which was unable expected.", "negative"),
